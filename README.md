5. Seperating the categorical and numerical features
6. Univariate analysis
7. Bivariate analysis

   In this Project, EDA is indispensable in extracting actionable insights from raw data, especially in domains like real estate where numerous factors contribute to the final property value. Through EDA, we can identify key variables that significantly impact house prices, allowing us to tailor pricing strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and gain a competitive edge in the market. Moreover, EDA helps us uncover hidden relationships, outliers, and trends that may be obscured at first glance, ensuring a comprehensive analysis that goes beyond surface-level observations.
